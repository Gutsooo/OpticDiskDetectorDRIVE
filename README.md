<h1 align="center">Optic Disk Detection in Retinal Images using Hough Transform and Preprocessing Techniques</h1>
<p align="center">

</p>
This repository contains a custom approach for detecting circles in retinal images from the DRIVE dataset. The project utilizes the Hough transform along with preprocessing techniques such as image enhancement and edge detection to accurately identify circular structures in the images. This is essential for analyzing retinal images and diagnosing eye-related diseases like diabetic retinopathy.

### Main Methods Used:

1. **Preprocessing Techniques:** Applied various preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, contrast adjustment, histogram equalization, and adaptive thresholding to improve the quality of retinal images for better circle detection.

2. **Edge Detection:** Utilized edge detection algorithms, such as the Canny edge detector, to identify the boundaries of circular structures in the images.

3. **Hough Transform:** Implemented the Hough transform algorithm to detect circles by finding the best-fitting circle based on the image's edge information.
